        An iterable dataset for when the training set is too large to hold in memory.
        Also applies a weight for each event, which is either used for sampling or for use in the loss function

        Works with multithreading.
        Epoch start:
         - Each thread is assigned a mututally explusive collection of HDF files (its worker_files).
         - Each thread groups its assigned files into mini collections of size n_ofiles (its ofiles_list).
         - Each thread loops through its mini collection of files
             - It reads chunk of data from each file in the mini collection and fills a buffer (shuffled).
                - It calculates sample weights for the whole buffer
                    - It loops through the buffer and weights, yeilding samples
                - When the buffer is empty the thread loads new chucks from each file in the current mini collection
             - When the mini collection is empty it moves to the next one are empty then it opens a new set from its file list
         - When the file list is empty then the thread is finished for its epoch

        Minimal memory footprint. Amount of data stored in memory at given time is:
            - sample_size x chunk_size x n_ofiles x n_threads
